                <p class="col-md-12">Located about 20 km from the city of Chandigarh is a renowned historical
                    temple
                    called Saketri Shiva Temple. This beautifully constructed temple is wholly dedicated to Lord Shiva.
                    This temple is thronged by large number of devotees during the occasion of Shivratri. About 5 km
                    from this Shiva temple is the Mansa Devi temple. More than thousands of devotees target this shrine
                    on Shivratri day to obtain the blessings of Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is one among the gods in Hindu
                    trinity of the great Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. On this concept, Brahma is known to be the creator,
                    Vishnu is known as preserver and Shiva is known to be destroyer. Shiva was basically known as tribal
                    lord during Indus Valley Civilization, even before the notion of Vishnu or Brahma came to existence.
                    Lord Shiva is referred to be eternal and boundless. The famous Mahashivratri festival is known to be
                    celebrated in honor of God Shiva, the third lord in the Hindu Trinity. This festival is celebrated
                    annually on 14th night of new moon at the dark half month of Phalguna. During this period,
                    celebrations take place all over the country.
                    <br>
                    All over the country, people keep fasting and perform
                    ritual prayers during night time. There is a belief that Parvati enquired Shiva as which vrata is
                    considered to be the best to acquire maximum puniya and also his bhakti, Shiva replied her referring
                    this auspicious day. During this period of Mahashivratri, Lord Shiva will be given bath with five
                    sacred products of cow, commonly known as panchagavya-butter, milk, urine, sour milk and cow dung.
                    Followed by this, the five types of food items which are known to symbolize immortality like curd,
                    clarified butter, milk, sugar and honey are offered to Shivlinga.

                <p class="col-md-12">Sukhna Lake is the most popular attraction of Chandigarh. I visited there in
                    the evening. There are many types of boats available for boating. I took a luxury boat that cost me
                    Rs 400. It was the best 30 minutes of my trip. Boating in the evening as the sun was hiding behind
                    the Shivalik hills was enthralling. Apart from boating there are also many other things to do in
                    Sukhna Lake like a kids amusement park, getting your portrait made, relax on the rock wall, and bird
                    watching.
                    <br>
                    The lake was created by Le Corbusier and the Chief Engineer P L Verma. To preserve its tranquility,
                    Corbusier insisted on two things: that it be forbidden for motor boats to circulate in the water,
                    and for vehicular traffic to be prohibited on top of the dam (promenade).The lake is fringed by a
                    golf course to the south, and Nek Chand's famous Rock Garden of Chandigarh to its west.

                <p class="col-md-12">The Rock Garden sits near Sukhna Lake. It consists of man-made interlinked
                    waterfalls and many other sculptures that have been made of scrap and other kinds of waste (bottles,
                    glasses, bangles, tiles, ceramic pots, sinks, electrical waste, broken pipes, etc.) which are placed
                    in walled paths.[citation needed]
                    <br>
                    The garden is most famous for its sculptures made from recycled ceramic
                    In his spare time, Nek Chand started collecting materials from demolition sites around the city. He
                    recycled these materials into his own vision of the divine kingdom of Sukrani, choosing a gorge in a
                    forest near Sukhna Lake for his work. The gorge had been designated as a land conservancy, a forest
                    buffer established in 1902 that nothing could be built on. Chand's work was illegal, but he was able
                    to hide it for 18 years before it was discovered by the authorities in 1976. By this time, it had
                    grown into a 12-acre (4.9 ha) complex of interlinked courtyards, each filled with hundreds of
                    pottery-covered concrete sculptures of dancers, musicians, and animals.
                    <br>
                    Waterfall and path at Rock Garden, Chandigarh
                    His work was in danger of being demolished, but he was able to get public opinion on his side. In
                    1976 the park was inaugurated as a public space. Nek Chand was given a salary, a title
                    ("Sub-Divisional Engineer, Rock Garden") and 50 laborers so that he could work full-time. The Rock
                    Garden appeared on an Indian stamp in 1983. The Rock Garden is still made out of recycled
                    materials. With the government's help, Chand was able to set up collection centers around the city
                    for waste, especially rags and broken ceramics.
                    <br>
                    When Chand left the country on a lecture tour in 1996, the city withdrew its funding, and vandals
                    attacked the park. The Rock Garden Society took over the administration and upkeep of this unique
                    visionary environment.
                    <br>
                    The garden is visited by over 5,000 people daily, with more than 12 million visitors since its
                    inception.

                    is the golf cart availability as it could be a tiring to walk. However one has to pay extra for the
                    golf cart ride. Lion safari is not as great as it sounds however worth going to see the king of the
                    jungle. There is a small canteen which can cater the needs of the hungry people. Please keep hats
                    and sunscreen ready on sunny days and hydrate your self.
